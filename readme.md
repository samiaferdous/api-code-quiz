TITLE: API & JAVASCRIPT QUIZ CHALLENGE

OBJECTIVES:
- Design an online quiz
- Add a timer that counts down
- Time is deducted when question is answered incorrectly
- When the questions are answered or time runs out, tally score
- Display Highscores, save to Local Storage

HOW IT WORKS:
On the first page, you are presented with 5 questions. Once you answer, you are told if the answer was correct or incorrect. You have 100 seconds until the timer runs out. Upon ending the game, you can save the score with your Initials.
